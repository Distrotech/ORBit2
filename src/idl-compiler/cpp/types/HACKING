So here's my writeup of how I'm going to restructure this big
mess. The new approach is to be more flexible, but at the same time,
more high-level.

The new code is to be based on operations one does with CORBA
types. There are four operations:

   1. Definition
   2. As parameters to a CORBA interface's method
   3. As return values of a CORBA interface's method
   4. As a member of another, composite type


1. Definition
This currently implemented in the pass_* source files, so we won't
bother with them for the time being.


2. As parameters to a CORBA interface's method
3. As return values of a CORBA interface's method
These can be broken up into several smaller steps:
   -- Stub code
      -- Argument declaration in stub signature
      -- Preparing for the call
      -- Doing the call
      -- Optional post-call stuff
   -- Skel code
      (same steps)

Each type implements each of these steps, via the
{stub,skel}_{decl,impl}_{arg,ret}_* methods. It is perfectly valid to
do nothing in the pre/post code -- for example, since atomic C++ types
are simple typedefs of the C types, you can do a call instantly
without any setup in pre/post-call time.


4. As a member of another, composite type
The steps needed are:
   -- Getting the C++ type used for composite members of that type
	(e.g. CORBA::Object --> CORBA::Object_ptr)
   -- Converting from C++ member type to C member type and vice versa
